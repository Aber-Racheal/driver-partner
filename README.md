## Overview

**Tugende Driver Partner Feature** is a web-based prototype built to enhance the **Tugende Boda** app experience by offering new value to riders beyond loans. This project aims to:

- Empower riders with **gig/job opportunities**  
- Provide **trusted fuel & garage offers**  
- Introduce **Tupoints loyalty system**  
- Enable a **Bike Exchange/Upgrade** program  
- Transform the relationship from a loan-only system to a **partner ecosystem**  

You can try the live version here:

## Features

- **Driver Partner Unlock** ‚Äî After a rider makes their first on-time repayment, new features unlock.  
- **Gig/Job Listings** ‚Äî Riders can see and apply for gigs directly in the app.  
- **Fuel & Garage Offers** ‚Äî Access to vetted offers for keeping bikes on the road.  
- **Tupoints Loyalty System** ‚Äî Earn points and redeem them for fuel, services, or partial loan pay-down.  
- **Bike Exchange Program** ‚Äî Trade in an existing Tugende bike and upgrade to a newer model with a fair top-up cost and terms.

## Problem Statement

Many riders faced a limited relationship:  
- They‚Äôd get a boda on loan, make repayments, and that was it.  
- They struggled to reliably find gigs and faced untrusted mechanics.  
- Beyond safety training, there were **few to no incentives or support systems** after obtaining the loan.

This project addresses that gap by turning Tugende from just a financier into a **true partner in the rider‚Äôs journey**.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (React-based)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Deployment:** Vercel  
- **Language & Types:** TypeScript  
- **Other Tools:** ESLint, PostCSS, etc.

The app is structured around pages/routes, components, services (API calls, business logic), and UI modules (offers, exchange, loyalty, etc.).
